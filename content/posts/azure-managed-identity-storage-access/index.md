In many occasions you will face a need to use PowerShell from an Azure VM (or VM Scale Set) to connect to an Azure Storage Account to store or to retrieve some data which most probably could be a blob within a container. At the same time, you'd like to store blobs securely and avoid having public accessible blobs. You are more likely want to avoid the need to create Shared Access Signatures (SAS tokens), or even expose and manage the Storage Account Access Keys. Well! The solution to that is through authenticating to the Storage Account using Azure Managed Identities.

There are two two types of Azure Managed Identities (an Azure artifact/resource that is backed with autonomous Azure AD Service Principal that is employing self-managed credentials):
System assigned managed identity (SAMI): It's a mapped identity to the resource (it's 1-1 relationship), where the lifecycle of the identity is tied to the lifecycle of the Azure resource itself (CSP responsibility).
User assigned managed identity (UAMI): It's an independent identity that can be assigned to multiple Azure resources  (it's 1-âˆž relationship), making it flexible. However, the lifecycle of the identity is managed separately from the resources (Customer responsibility).

In this post, I will demonstrate with user assigned managed identity as it has various implementation scenarios. Before you start make sure that you have created a USMI and assigned it to a VM in Azure.

In the example script-snippet below, you'll notice the following

1. The PowerShell modules needed to run the used cmdlets are the following. Make sure you install them wherever you're running the script:

    [Az.Accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.accounts) { Connect-AzAccount }

    [Az.Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage) { New-AzStorageContext, New-AzStorageContainer, Set-AzStorageBlobContent }

    [Az.ManagedServiceIdentity](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.managedserviceidentity/) { Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity }

2. Using parameter -Identity in Connect-AzAccount is the secret that allows us to leverage managed identities.  Providing the other parameter -AccountId is necessary only when there are more than one Managed Identity linked to the Azure resource, to solve the confusion. Otherwise the first managed identity in the list will be selected by default. In other words, it's not necessary if you are using only one user assigned managed identity or if you are using system assigned managed identity. More here.

3. The cmdlet Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity was used to retrieve the ClientId of the managed identity. If you provide that value directly, then this line won't be necessary. Also, you would need to assign the managed identity Reader access over the resource group it belongs to.

4. When creating the Storage Account context, we needed to use the parameter â€“UseConnectedAccount to authenticate using OAuth Protocol. More here. After creating the context, then you'll continue interacting with Azure Storage Container similar as you do typically.

5. The permissions required to allow the managed identity to create a container and store a blob inside is Storage Blob Data Contributor.

```powershell
$resourceGroupName = '<resourceGroupName>'
$managedIdentityName = '<managedIdentityName>'
$storageAccountName = '<storageAccountName>'
$newContainerName = '<newContainerName>'
$uploadFilePath =  '<uploadFilePath i.e. c:\temp\image.png>'
$fileName = $uploadFilePath.Split('\')[-1]

#the following couple lines are optional if you are providing the ClientID directly
Connect-AzAccount -Identity
$managedIdentity = Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $managedIdentityName

#using -AccountId is only necessary when you have multiple managed identities linked to the Azure resource (i.e. Storage Account)
Connect-AzAccount -Identity -AccountId $managedIdentity.ClientId

$storageAccount = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName â€“UseConnectedAccount

$container = New-AzStorageContainer -Name $newContainerName -Context $storageAccount.Context -Permission blob

Set-AzStorageBlobContent -File $uploadFilePath -Container $container.Name -Blob $fileName -Context $storageAccount.Context

```
As you noticed from the script-snippet above that there was no credentials/passwords/passphrases/secrets/keys/certificates exposed. That's a big advantage of using managed identities, especially when storing scripts in code repository ðŸ˜‰ Think about it as the **passwordless infrastructure experience**. That's the beauty of  Azure Managed Identities!

As a side note, the same approach is achievable through Azure CLI. You'll just need to use the equivalent commands.

I hope this was a good introduction for you to start leveraging managed identities in your scripts.
